# Legacy Python Weather App

## Legacy Components
- [legacy/weather_app.py](mdc:legacy/weather_app.py) - Original Python weather application
- [legacy/requirements.txt](mdc:legacy/requirements.txt) - Python dependencies
- [legacy/__pycache__/](mdc:legacy/__pycache__/) - Python bytecode cache

## Migration Notes
- The Python version has been superseded by the React/TypeScript implementation
- Legacy code is preserved for reference and potential future use
- Python dependencies and functionality are documented in the legacy files
- Consider removing legacy code if no longer needed

## If Working with Legacy Code
- Use Python 3.8+ for compatibility
- Install dependencies with: `pip install -r legacy/requirements.txt`
- The Python app provided current weather and 5-day forecasts via OpenWeatherMap API
- Legacy code should not be modified unless specifically requested
